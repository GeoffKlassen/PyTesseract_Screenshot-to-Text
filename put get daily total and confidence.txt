put "get daily total and confidence" into each branch of the "if" clause
change if-elif to all ifs, in case each category happens to be in the screenshot
feed the heading above and heading below into the 'get daily total and confidence' function, instead of having it be a couple of variables in the Screenshot object

do not crop left or crop right for the prescean  then use th df_words to find the app names (used for rmoving black bars anyway) and crop the image to the app name edge
use the same crop left value for the crop right ( image width - cropleft)



create a new box the same height as the app name, that starts just bleow the app name. scan to the right for pixels that aren't all the same. once you find some, keep going nstil you find another few columns that are all the same, this is where the app number is. crop to the app number and append it to the right of the app name. now scan the whole pasted image for text, maybe this will help you find app numbers easier?
- possible issues-- if the textbox you create below the app name is too close to the bottom of the screen or the left edge of it contains not all one colour of pixel - then I guess you could remove the bottom rows?
